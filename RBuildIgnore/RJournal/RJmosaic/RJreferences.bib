@ARTICLE{Grolemund:ISR:2014,

author = {Grolemund, Garrett and Wickham, Hadley},
year = {2014},
journal = {International Statistical Review},
volume = {82},
number = {2},
pages = {184--204},
abstract = {This paper proposes a scientific model to explain the analysis
process. We argue that data analysis is primarily a procedure to build
understanding, and as such, it dovetails with the cognitive processes of the
human mind. Data analysis tasks closely resemble the cognitive process known as
sensemaking. We demonstrate how data analysis is a sensemaking task adapted to
use quantitative data. This identification highlights a universal structure
within data analysis activities and provides a foundation for a theory of data
analysis. The competing tensions of cognitive compatibility and scientific
rigour create a series of problems that characterise the data analysis process.
These problems form a useful organising model for the data analysis task while
allowing methods to remain flexible and situation dependent. The insights of
this model are especially helpful for consultants, applied statisticians and
teachers of data analysis.},
